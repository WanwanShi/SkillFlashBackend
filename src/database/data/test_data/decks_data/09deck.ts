  {
    "Q": "What is a class and an object in OOP? Provide an example to illustrate their relationship. ",
    "A": "A class is a blueprint that defines the properties and methods (functions) common to a category of objects. An object is an instance of a class, created using the class as a template. For example, a \"Dog\" class defines attributes like breed and methods like bark(), and an object of this class represents a specific dog with its unique attributes.

  },
  {
    "Q": "How does encapsulation work in OOP, and what benefits does it provide?",
    "A": "Encapsulation is the mechanism of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, called a class. It hides the internal details of an object and provides a public interface for interaction, protecting the data from unauthorized access and modification. (Source: Encapsulation in OOP)",

  },
  {
    "Q": "What is abstraction in OOP, and how does it help simplify complex systems?",
    "A": "Abstraction in OOP is the process of hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features and functionalities of an object. It helps simplify complex systems by providing a higher-level view, allowing users to focus on the object's functionality rather than its internal workings. (Source: Abstraction in OOP)",

  },
  {
    "Q": "How does inheritance facilitate code reuse and extension in OOP? Provide an example.",
    "A": "Inheritance is a mechanism in OOP where a new class (subclass or derived class) inherits the properties and behaviors of an existing class (base class or parent class). This allows the subclass to reuse and extend the functionality of the base class. For example, a \"Poodle\" class can inherit from the \"Dog\" class and add specific attributes and behaviors.

  },
  {
    "Q": "What is polymorphism in OOP, and how does it contribute to flexible and extensible code?",
    "A": "Polymorphism refers to the ability to create multiple forms of a single behavior. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, enabling flexible and extensible code. Methods can be overridden in subclasses, providing specific implementations while maintaining a consistent interface. (Source: Polymorphism in OOP)",

  },
  {
    "Q": "Explain the concept of \"sprints\" in Scrum and how they contribute to iterative development.",
    "A": "Sprints are fixed-length iterations, typically lasting one to four weeks, during which a \"done\" product increment is created. They provide a consistent rhythm for development, with clear start and end dates, fostering focus and incremental progress. Sprints encourage feedback and adaptation, leading to iterative development and continuous improvement. (Source: Scrum Guide, Section 2.2)",

  },
  {
    "Q": "How does the Scrum framework facilitate adaptability and transparency in software development?",
    "A": "Scrum promotes adaptability by encouraging empirical process control, where transparency, inspection, and adaptation are key. All work is made transparent through artifacts like the product backlog and sprint backlog. Regular inspections, such as daily stand-ups and sprint reviews, facilitate feedback and adaptation, ensuring the team can respond to change effectively. (Source: Scrum Guide, Section 2.1)",

  {
    "Q": "What is the difference between a Scrum Master and a traditional project manager?",
    "A": "A Scrum Master is a servant leader who ensures the Scrum team adheres to Scrum values, rules, and practices. They facilitate meetings, remove impediments, and foster an environment for high-performance teams. In contrast, a traditional project manager is responsible for planning, organizing, and directing a project, often with a more hierarchical and predictive approach.

    "Q": "What is a \" Definition of Done\" in Scrum, and why is it important?",
    "A": "The Definition of Done (DoD) is a set of criteria that must be met for a product increment to be considered complete and potentially releasable. It ensures transparency and a consistent understanding of what \"done\" means across the team. The DoD provides clarity on the level of quality expected and helps in estimating and planning work during sprint planning. (Source: Scrum Guide, Section 8.4)",

  {
    "Q": "How does the Scrum framework handle risks and impediments during development?",
    "A": "Scrum addresses risks and impediments through its iterative and incremental approach, short feedback loops, and transparency. Risks are identified and addressed early due to the frequent inspection and adaptation cycles. Impediments are obstacles that hinder the team's progress and are identified and removed through the Scrum Master's facilitation and the team's collaboration.
